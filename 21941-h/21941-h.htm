<p>
'T was a peaceful summer's morning, when the first thing gave us warning<br />
Was the booming of the cannon from the river and the shore:<br />
"Child," says grandma, "what's the matter, what is all this noise and clatter?<br />
Have those scalping Indian devils come to murder us once more?"<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illo_11.jpg"  width="414" height="600" alt="'T was a peaceful summer's morning" title="" /></div>

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
Poor old soul! my sides were shaking in the midst of all my quaking,<br />
To hear her talk of Indians when the guns began to roar:<br />
She had seen the burning village, and the slaughter and the pillage,<br />
When the Mohawks killed her father with their bullets through his door.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
Then I said, "Now, dear old granny, don't you fret and worry any,<br />
For I'll soon come back and tell you whether this is work or play;<br />
There can't be mischief in it, so I won't be gone a minute"&mdash;<br />
For a minute then I started. I was gone the livelong day.</p>
<p><br />
No time for bodice-lacing or for looking-glass grimacing;<br />
Down my hair went as I hurried, tumbling half-way to my heels;<br />
God forbid your ever knowing, when there's blood around her flowing,<br />
How the lonely, helpless daughter of a quiet household feels!<br />

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
In the street I heard a thumping; and I knew it was the stumping<br />
Of the Corporal, our old neighbor, on that wooden leg he wore,<br />
With a knot of women round him,&mdash;it was lucky I had found him,<br />
So I followed with the others, and the Corporal marched before.<br />
<br /><br />
They were making for the steeple,&mdash;the old soldier and his people;<br />
The pigeons circled round us as we climbed the creaking stair,<br />
Just across the narrow river&mdash;oh, so close it made me shiver!&mdash;<br />
Stood a fortress on the hill-top that but yesterday was bare.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
Not slow our eyes to find it; well we knew who stood behind it,<br />
Though the earthwork hid them from us, and the stubborn walls were dumb:<br />
Here were sister, wife, and mother, looking wild upon each other,<br />
And their lips were white with terror as they said, <span class="smcap">The hour has come</span>!<br />
<br /><br />
The morning slowly wasted, not a morsel had we tasted,<br />
And our heads were almost splitting with the cannons' deafening thrill,<br />
When a figure tall and stately round the rampart strode sedately;<br />
It was <span class="smcap">Prescott</span>, one since told me; he commanded on the hill.<br />
</p></div>

</div>

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
Every woman's heart grew bigger when we saw his manly figure,<br />
With the banyan buckled round it, standing up so straight and tall;<br />
Like a gentleman of leisure who is strolling out for pleasure,<br />
Through the storm of shells and cannon-shot he walked around the wall.<br />
<br /><br />
At eleven the streets were swarming, for the red-coats' ranks were forming;<br />
At noon in marching order they were moving to the piers;<br />
How the bayonets gleamed and glistened, as we looked far down, and listened<br />
To the trampling and the drum-beat of the belted grenadiers!<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 423px;">
<img src="images/img27.jpg" width="423" height="600" alt="At eleven the streets were swarming" title="" />
</div>

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
At length the men have started, with a cheer (it seemed faint-hearted),<br />
In their scarlet regimentals, with their knapsacks on their backs,<br />
And the reddening, rippling water, as after a sea-fight's slaughter,<br />
Round the barges gliding onward blushed like blood along their tracks.<br />
<br /><br />
So they crossed to the other border, and again they formed in order;<br />
And the boats came back for soldiers, came for soldiers, soldiers still:<br />
The time seemed everlasting to us women faint and fasting,&mdash;<br />
At last they're moving, marching, marching proudly up the hill.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 447px;">
<img src="images/img28.jpg" width="447" height="600" alt="And the boats came back for soldiers" title="" />

</div>

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
We can see the bright steel glancing all along the lines advancing&mdash;<br />
Now the front rank fires a volley&mdash;they have thrown away their shot;<br />
For behind their earthwork lying, all the balls above them flying,<br />
Our people need not hurry; so they wait and answer not.<br />
<br /><br />
Then the Corporal, our old cripple (he would swear sometimes and tipple),&mdash;<br />
He had heard the bullets whistle (in the old French war) before,&mdash;<br />
Calls out in words of jeering, just as if they all were hearing,&mdash;<br />
And his wooden leg thumps fiercely on the dusty belfry floor:&mdash;<br />
</p></div>

<p>
"Oh! fire away, ye villains, and earn King George's shillin's,<br />
But ye'll waste a ton of powder afore a 'rebel' falls;<br />
You may bang the dirt and welcome, they're as safe as Dan'l Malcolm<br />
Ten foot beneath the gravestone that you've splintered with your balls!"<br />
<br /><br />
In the hush of expectation, in the awe and trepidation<br />
Of the dread approaching moment, we are well-nigh breathless all;<br />
Though the rotten bars are failing on the rickety belfry railing,<br />
We are crowding up against them like the waves against a wall.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
Just a glimpse (the air is clearer), they are nearer,&mdash;nearer,&mdash;nearer,<br />
When a flash&mdash;a curling smoke-wreath&mdash;then a crash&mdash;the steeple shakes&mdash;<br />
The deadly truce is ended; the tempest's shroud is rended;<br />
Like a morning mist it gathered, like a thunder-cloud it breaks!<br />
<br /><br />
Oh the sight our eyes discover as the blue-black smoke blows over!<br />
The red-coats stretched in windrows as a mower rakes his hay;<br />
Here a scarlet heap is lying, there a headlong crowd is flying<br />
Like a billow that has broken and is shivered into spray.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 392px;">

</div>

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
Then we cried, "The troops are routed! they are beat&mdash;it can't be doubted!<br />
God be thanked, the fight is over!"&mdash;Ah! the grim old soldier's smile!<br />
"Tell us, tell us why you look so?" (we could hardly speak, we shook so),&mdash;<br />
"Are they beaten? <i>Are</i> they beaten? <span class="smcap">Are</span> they beaten?"&mdash;"Wait a while."<br />
<br /><br />
Oh the trembling and the terror! for too soon we saw our error:<br />
They are baffled, not defeated; we have driven them back in vain;<br />
And the columns that were scattered, round the colors that were tattered,<br />
Toward the sullen, silent fortress turn their belted breasts again.<br />
</p></div>

</div>

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
All at once, as we are gazing, lo the roofs of Charlestown blazing!<br />
They have fired the harmless village; in an hour it will be down!<br />
The Lord in heaven confound them, rain his fire and brimstone round them,&mdash;<br />
The robbing, murdering red-coats, that would burn a peaceful town!<br />
<br /><br />
They are marching, stern and solemn; we can see each massive column<br />
As they near the naked earth-mound with the slanting walls so steep.<br />
Have our soldiers got faint-hearted, and in noiseless haste departed?<br />
Are they panic-struck and helpless? Are they palsied or asleep?<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 438px;">

</div>

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
Now! the walls they're almost under! scarce a rod the foes asunder!<br />
Not a firelock flashed against them! up the earthwork they will swarm!<br />
But the words have scarce been spoken, when the ominous calm is broken,<br />
And a bellowing crash has emptied all the vengeance of the storm!<br />
<br /><br />
So again, with murderous slaughter, pelted backwards to the water,<br />
Fly Pigot's running heroes and the frightened braves of Howe;<br />
And we shout, "At last they're done for, it's their barges they have run for:<br />
They are beaten, beaten, beaten; and the battle's over now!"<br />
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;">

</div>

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
And we looked, poor timid creatures, on the rough old soldier's features,<br />
Our lips afraid to question, but he knew what we would ask:<br />
"Not sure," he said; "keep quiet,&mdash;once more, I guess, they'll try it&mdash;<br />
Here's damnation to the cut-throats!"&mdash;then he handed me his flask,<br />
<br /><br />
Saying, "Gal, you're looking shaky; have a drop of old Jamaiky;
I'm afeard there'll be more trouble afore the job is done;"
So I took one scorching swallow; dreadful faint I felt and hollow,
Standing there from early morning when the firing was begun.
</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 401px;">

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
All through those hours of trial I had watched a calm clock dial,<br />
As the hands kept creeping, creeping,&mdash;they were creeping round to four,<br />
When the old man said, "They're forming with their bagonets fixed for storming:<br />
It's the death-grip that's a-coming,&mdash;they will try the works once more."<br />
<br /><br />
With brazen trumpets blaring, the flames behind them glaring,<br />
The deadly wall before them, in close array they come;<br />
Still onward, upward toiling, like a dragon's fold uncoiling,&mdash;<br />
Like the rattlesnake's shrill warning the reverberating drum!<br />
</p></div>

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
Over heaps all torn and gory&mdash;shall I tell the fearful story,<br />
How they surged above the breast-work, as a sea breaks over a deck;<br />
How, driven, yet scarce defeated, our worn-out men retreated,<br />
With their powder-horns all emptied, like the swimmers from a wreck?<br />
<br /><br />
It has all been told and painted; as for me, they say I fainted,<br />
And the wooden-legged old Corporal stumped with me down the stair:<br />
When I woke from dreams affrighted the evening lamps were lighted,&mdash;<br />
On the floor a youth was lying; his bleeding breast was bare.<br />
</p></div>

</div>

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
And I heard through all the flurry, "Send for <span class="smcap">Warren</span>! hurry! hurry!<br />
Tell him here's a soldier bleeding, and he'll come and dress his wound!"<br />
Ah, we knew not till the morrow told its tale of death and sorrow,<br />
How the starlight found him stiffened on the dark and bloody ground.<br />
<br /><br />
Who the youth was, what his name was, where the place from which he came was,<br />
Who had brought him from the battle, and had left him at our door,<br />
He could not speak to tell us; but 't was one of our brave fellows,<br />
As the homespun plainly showed us which the dying soldier wore.<br />
</p></div>

<div class="cpoem">
<p>
For they all thought he was dying, as they gathered round him crying,&mdash;<br />
And they said, "Oh, how they'll miss him!" and "What <i>will</i> his mother do?"<br />
Then, his eyelids just unclosing like a child's that has been dozing,<br />
He faintly murmured, "Mother!"&mdash;and&mdash;I saw his eyes were blue.<br />
<br /><br />
"Why, grandma, how you're winking!" Ah, my child, it sets me thinking<br />
Of a story not like this one. Well, he somehow lived along;<br />
So we came to know each other, and I nursed him like a&mdash;mother,<br />
Till at last he stood before me, tall, and rosy-cheeked, and strong.<br />

<p>
And we sometimes walked together in the pleasant summer weather,<br />
&mdash;"Please to tell us what his name was?" Just your own, my little dear,&mdash;<br />
There's his picture Copley painted: we became so well acquainted,<br />
That&mdash;in short, that's why I'm grandma, and you children all are here!<br />
